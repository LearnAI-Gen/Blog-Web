    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into various sectors of society, including social work. As this field embraces digital transformation, AI presents both opportunities and ethical challenges for professionals working with vulnerable populations.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of AI in Social Work</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Automating routine tasks like scheduling or data entry frees up time for social workers to focus on human-centered care.</li>
      <li><strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong> AI can identify at-risk individuals by analyzing historical data, enabling early intervention.</li>
      <li><strong>24/7 Accessibility:</strong> Chatbots and virtual agents offer round-the-clock support for clients needing assistance outside normal hours.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ethical Concerns</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bias and Fairness:</strong> AI systems can replicate or amplify biases in the data they’re trained on, leading to discriminatory outcomes.</li>
      <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Handling sensitive client data requires strict safeguards to protect confidentiality and avoid misuse.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> AI decision-making processes can be opaque, making it difficult for social workers or clients to understand or challenge outcomes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Role of the Human Touch</h2>
    <p>While AI can enhance support services, it cannot replace the empathy, cultural competence, and judgment that human social workers provide. A balanced approach that integrates AI tools without losing sight of core social work values is essential.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>AI offers promising advancements in social work, but these must be implemented ethically and responsibly. Ongoing education, inclusive design, and strong regulation are key to ensuring AI serves the best interests of those it aims to help.</p>
